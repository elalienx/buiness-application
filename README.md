# Business Application

The goal is to inpire the team to refactor the Business Application page inside the Admin web application, so we can develop faster, with less bugs.

The goal is not to propose a new User Experience (UX), User Interface (UI), or web frameworks. I just use certain technologies to create a demostration as quick as possible.

# Features

- It uses hardcoded data exported from the real application to fill the page.
- It has a folder structure more complex than necesary to mimic how it could be ported to an existing monorepo.

# How to run

1. Clone the repository.
1. Install dependencies with `npm install`
1. Start the project with `npm run dev`

# Tech stack

1. ShadCN for UI.
1. Zustand for state management.
1. Playwright for End to End testing (E2E).
